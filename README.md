# Car Sales-Dashboard-PowerBI
🚗 Car Sales Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project 📊
Transforming raw dealership data into actionable business insights!

🧩 Problem Statements:
1️⃣ Sales managers lacked visibility into real-time performance trends like total sales, revenue, and car sold metrics across different timeframes.
2️⃣ Comparing year-over-year performance was difficult without a unified view of KPIs like average price, total units sold, and market growth.
3️⃣ There was no streamlined method to analyze sales distribution across car body styles, colors, or regions, making it hard to optimize marketing or stock.
4️⃣ Insights into monthly vs. yearly performance, as well as key differences in sales trends, were manually intensive and not dynamic.
5️⃣ Stakeholders struggled to access a user-friendly dashboard with interactive filters, making customized reporting time-consuming.

✅ How I Solved It:
To address these challenges, I designed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that’s visually appealing, interactive, and business-focused.

🔍 Key Solutions Delivered:
📌 KPI Design: Developed Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD), and Previous Year KPIs for:

Total Sales

Average Price

Units Sold
➡️ Each metric includes a visual indicator (color-coded) for growth/decline.

📉 Trend Analysis:
Built area charts showing weekly sales trends and YOY price growth, with automated markers for peak performance points.

🧠 Comparative Metrics:
Used DAX functions like TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, and IF logic to calculate:

Price Differences

Sales Growth %

Color-coded KPI variances

🌍 Category Breakdown:
Used donut charts and map visuals to reveal:

Sales share by car body style

Color preferences among buyers

Regional performance of dealerships

📊 Company-wise Performance Table:
Created a dynamic matrix showing:

Average selling price

Cars sold per company

Sales share as % of grand total
➡️ Enhanced with data bars and conditional formatting.

🧩 Detailed Drill-down Page:
Designed a second dashboard for granular-level tracking, including:

Car ID, Customer Name, Dealer, Model, Price, Date, and Region

🔘 Smart Filtering & Navigation:
Included slicers for body style, engine type, region, transmission, and dealer—plus navigation buttons for seamless page switching.

🎯 Impact:
This dashboard enables:

Instant performance comparisons across timelines

Strategic decisions on inventory, pricing, and promotions

Stakeholder alignment with a self-serve, filterable view

Greater transparency into dealership operations
